          A T2mon can be caught in battle using a jar. Once the T2mon is caught,
          the fight ends and it is sent to the team. If the team is full, the
          T2mon is sent to your storage space.
        </>

    {
      title: <>What is the order of appearance of T2mon?</>,
      txt: (
        <>
          In a fight, the T2mon appear in the order in which they are organized
          in the team. When a T2mon is knocked out, the first able-bodied T2mon
          in order of appearance is dispatched. This order can be changed in the
          "Team" section of the menu.
        </>

      title: <>How does the fight end?</>,
      txt: (
        <>
          The fight ends when the opposing T2mon is knocked out or caught. The
          T2mon who struck the last blow then wins experience and the player
          gold. If the player's entire team is knocked out, he loses gold. Wild
          T2mons can still spawn if the team is in no fighting condition so be
          careful.
