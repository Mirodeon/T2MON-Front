            I have just recently started my adventure in web development a few
            months ago in a training course at BeCode. The resources and
            knowledge that can be drawn from this kind of training being
            insufficient to satisfy me, I decided to embark on this personal
            project in order to satisfy my curiosity and had a lot of fun making
            it.
